Legacy App Workflow
===================

[Example App](app) made with spring to show legacy app workflow.

##Possible Workflow

1. legacy app with no documentation
2. add [swagger-springmvc](https://github.com/springfox/springfox) as dependency and configure accordingly
3. check generated [api-docs](http://localhost:8080/api-docs) with browser
4. add [swagger-ui](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui) as dependency and configure 
5. call [swagger-ui](http://localhost:8080/) in browser
6. change [URL of swagger-ui page](http://localhost:8080/swagger.html) and customize page if needed 

Now you have a better documented App.
